##Problem
The selected machine learning problem is predicting whether a student will be accepted into a university based on their academic information.
This problem is considered Supervised Learning because we use previous admission data that already includes the final decision (accepted or not accepted). It is a Binary Classification problem since there are only two possible outcomes:
* 1 = Admitted
* 0 = Not Admitted

##Summary
The main goal of is to build a machine learning model that can predict if a student will be accepted into a university depending on their academic performance.
The prediction will be based on information such as test scores, GPA, and research experience. The model will learn from past student data and try to find patterns that help in making future predictions.
This problem is useful because it shows how machine learning can be applied in the education field and helps students understand their chances of admission.
